# Code Snippets Algorithms
List of Algorithm topics and their code snippets!

## Algorithm Analysis

## Linked List

## Stack and Queue

## Recursion

## Binary Tree

## Binary Search Tree

## Heap

## Sorting
#### Bubble Sort
#### Insertion Sort
#### Quick Sort
#### Selection Sort

## Searching
#### Linear Search
#### Binary Search
* Also known as Half-Interval Search, Logarithmic Search, Binary Chop.
* Elements in the array must be sorted before searching.
* This divides the search inetrval in falf.
* If the search value is less than the middle item of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Else narrow it to upper half
* Repeatedly check until the search value is found or the interval is empty
* In case of binary search, array elements must be in ascending order.



## Hashing

## AVL Tree

## Threaded Binary Tree

## Expression Tree

## B Tree

## Graph
* Adjacency matrix
* Adjacency list
* Path matrix
